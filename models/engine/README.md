I know you were waiting for it: it's here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until... the end of the first year.
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the
[AirBnB
website](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/m8g02HcD2ovrl_K-zulYBw "AirBnB website"){target="_blank"}.

You won't implement all the features, only some of them to cover all
fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

-   A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface,
    like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
-   A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody:
    static and dynamic
-   A database or files that store data (data = objects)
-   An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end
    and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Final product

style=""}

## Concepts to learn

-   [Unittest](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/87ml5W9WzLbH7yAJuGk_mA "Unittest"){target="_blank"} -
    and please work all together on tests cases
-   **Python packages** concept page
-   Serialization/Deserialization
-   `*args, **kwargs`
-   `datetime`
-   More coming soon!

## Steps

You won't build this application all at once, but step by step.

Each step will link to a concept:

### The console

-   create your data model
-   manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console /
    command interpreter
-   store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage
engine will give us an abstraction between "My object" and "How they are
stored and persisted". This means: from your console code (the command
interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build
later, you won't have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects
are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage
easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

style=""}

### Web static

-   learn HTML/CSS
-   create the HTML of your application
-   create template of each object

![](./Concept_%20AirBnB%20clone%20_%20ALX%20Africa%20Intranet_files/87c01524ada6080f40fc.png){loading="lazy"
style=""}

### MySQL storage

-   replace the file storage by a Database storage
-   map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

style=""}

### Web framework - templating

-   create your first web server in Python
-   make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file
    or database

![](./Concept_%20AirBnB%20clone%20_%20ALX%20Africa%20Intranet_files/cb778ec8a13acecb53ef.png){loading="lazy"
style=""}

### RESTful API

-   expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
-   manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

![](./Concept_%20AirBnB%20clone%20_%20ALX%20Africa%20Intranet_files/06fccc41df40ab8f9d49.png){loading="lazy"
style=""}

### Web dynamic

-   learn JQuery
-   load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

## Files and Directories

-   `models` directory will contain all classes used for the entire
    project. A class, called "model" in a OOP project is the
    representation of an object/instance.
-   `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
-   `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
-   `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It
    contains common elements:
    -   attributes: `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`
    -   methods: `save()` and `to_json()`
-   `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes (using
    the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one:
    `file_storage.py`.

## Storage

Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every
time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously
created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done
in a previous execution won't be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and
database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate "storage management" from "model"? It's to make your models
modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace
your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance
attributes? For 3 reasons:

-   Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see
    quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc...)
-   Provide default value of any attribute
-   In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or
    database storage

### How can I store my instances?

That's a good question. So let's take a look at this code:

    class Student():
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

    students = []
    s = Student("John")
    students.append(s)

Here, I'm creating a student and store it in a list. But after this
program execution, my Student instance doesn't exist anymore.

    class Student():
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

    students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
    s = Student("John")
    students.append(s)
    save(students) # save all Student objects to a file

Nice!

But how it works?

First, let's look at `save(students)`:

-   Can I write each `Student` object to a file =\> *NO*, it will be the
    memory representation of the object. For another program execution,
    this memory representation can't be reloaded.
-   Can I write each `Student.name` to a file =\> *YES*, but imagine you
    have other attributes to describe `Student`? It would start to be
    become too complex.

The best solution is to convert this list of `Student` objects to a JSON
representation.

Why JSON? Because it's a standard representation of object. It allows us
to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly
to be understood by another language/program.

Example:

-   My Python program creates `Student` objects and saves them to a JSON
    file
-   Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate
    its own `Student` class/representation

And the `reload()`? now you know the file is a JSON file representing
all `Student` objects. So `reload()` has to read the file, parse the
JSON string, and re-create `Student` objects based on this
data-structure.

### File storage == JSON serialization

For this first step, you have to write in a file all your
objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and
restore them when you start it. You can't store and restore a Python
instance of a class as "Bytes", the only way is to convert it to a
serializable data structure:

-   convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure
    (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method
    `my_instance.to_json()` to retrieve a dictionary
-   convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be
    YAML, XML, CSV...) - for us it will be a
    `my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)`
-   write this string to a file on disk

And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:

-   read a string from a file on disk
-   convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON
    representation, so it's easy to convert - for us it will be a
    `my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)`
-   convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a
    `my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)`

## `*args, **kwargs`

[How To Use
them](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/seHCY0Sq6m_-PBetEnBACg "How To Use them"){target="_blank"}

How do you pass arguments to a function?

    def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
        ...

    my_fct("Best", "School")

But with this function definition, you must call `my_fct` with 2
parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:

    def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
        ...

    my_fct("Best", "School")

What? What's `*args` and `**kwargs`?

-   `*args` is a Tuple that contains all arguments
-   `*kwargs` is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value

A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, `*args` is the list of anonymous arguments, no
name, just an order. `**kwargs` is the dictionary with all named
arguments.

Examples:

    def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
        print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

    my_fct() # () - {}
    my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
    my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
    my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
    my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
    my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}

Perfect? Of course you can mix both, but the order should be first all
anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:

    def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
        print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

    a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

    my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
    my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
    my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}

You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how
your variables are stored.

## `datetime`

`datetime` is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc...

In this example, you create an instance of `datetime` with the current
date and time:

    from datetime import datetime

    date_now = datetime.now()
    print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
    print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922

`date_now` is an object, so you can manipulate it:

    from datetime import timedelta

    date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
    print(date_tomorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922

... you can also store it:

    a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
    print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
    print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}

What? What's this format when a `datetime` instance is in a
datastructure??? It's unreadable.

How to make it readable:
[strftime](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mLLWq3qIJc396KdHxI7sBw "strftime"){target="_blank"}

    print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
    print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
